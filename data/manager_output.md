**Project Plan: Heart Disease Detection Model**

### Introduction
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can detect heart disease in patients with an accuracy of at least 90%. The dataset used for this project is obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

            "type": "MLOps Engineer",
            "quantity": 1
        }
    ]
}
```

### Project Plan

#### Data Preprocessing (2 days)
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values and outliers in the dataset.
2. **Data Normalization**: Scale the features to a common range to prevent feature dominance.
3. **Data Split**: Split the dataset into training (80%), validation (10%), and testing (10%) sets.

#### Model Development (4 days)
1. **Feature Engineering**: Extract relevant features from the dataset that contribute to heart disease detection.
2. **Model Selection**: Choose a suitable machine learning algorithm (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks) based on the dataset and problem complexity.
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Perform hyperparameter tuning using techniques like Grid Search, Random Search, or Bayesian Optimization to optimize the model's performance.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance on the validation set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

#### Model Optimization (2 days)
1. **Ensemble Methods**: Explore ensemble methods (e.g., Bagging, Boosting) to combine multiple models and improve overall performance.
2. **Transfer Learning**: Investigate the use of pre-trained models and fine-tune them on the heart disease dataset.

#### Model Deployment (2 days)
1. **Model Serving**: Deploy the trained model using a model serving platform (e.g., TensorFlow Serving, AWS SageMaker).
2. **API Development**: Develop a RESTful API to receive input data and return predictions.

### Timeline
The project is expected to be completed within 2 weeks, with the following milestones:

* Day 1-2: Data preprocessing
* Day 3-6: Model development
* Day 7-8: Model optimization
* Day 9-10: Model deployment
* Day 11-14: Testing and debugging

### Resources
The project requires the following resources:

* 1 Data Scientist for data preprocessing and feature engineering
* 1 ML Research Engineer for model development and optimization
* 1 MLOps Engineer for model deployment and API development

### Deliverables
The project deliverables include:

* A trained machine learning model with at least 90% accuracy on the test set
* A deployed model serving platform with a RESTful API
* A report detailing the project's methodology, results, and conclusions

### Code
The code for this project will be written in Python, using popular libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow. The code will be organized into separate modules for data preprocessing, model development, and model deployment.

Example code for data preprocessing:
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('heart_disease_dataset.csv')

# Handle missing values and outliers
df = df.dropna()
df = df[(df['age'] > 0) & (df['age'] < 100)]

# Scale the features
scaler = StandardScaler()
df[['age', 'sex', 'cp', 'trestbps', 'chol', 'fbs', 'restecg', 'thalach', 'exang', 'oldpeak', 'slope', 'ca', 'thal']] = scaler.fit_transform(df[['age', 'sex', 'cp', 'trestbps', 'chol', 'fbs', 'restecg', 'thalach', 'exang', 'oldpeak', 'slope', 'ca', 'thal']])
```
Example code for model development:
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Split the dataset into training and validation sets
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(df.drop('target', axis=1), df['target'], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a random forest classifier
rf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
rf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model's performance on the validation set
y_pred = rf.predict(X_val)
print('Validation Accuracy:', accuracy_score(y_val, y_pred))
```
