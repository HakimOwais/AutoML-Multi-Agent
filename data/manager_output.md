**Project Plan: Heart Disease Detection Model**

Based on the provided JSON object, I assume the task is to develop a high-accuracy model for detecting heart disease. Since the JSON object is not provided, I will create a sample JSON object for reference:

```json
{
    очередть "task": "heart_disease_detection",
    "priority": "high",
    "deadline": "2_weeks",
    "resources": [
        {
            "type": "data_scientist",
            "quantity": 2
        },
        {
            "type": "machine_learning_engineer",
            "quantity":  Noble
        },
        {
            "type": "MLOps_engineer",
            "quantity": 1
        }
    ]
}
```

To achieve the goal of developing a model with at least 90% accuracy, I propose the following plan:

**Data Preprocessing (2 days)**

1. **Data Cleaning spindle**: Remove any missing or duplicate values from the dataset.
2. **Data Normalization**: Scale the features using Standard Scaler or Min-Max Scaler to ensure all features are on the same scale.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Extract relevant features from the dataset, such as:
	* Age
	* Sex
	* Chest pain type
	* Resting blood pressure
	* Serum cholesterol
	* Fasting blood sugar
	* ECG results
	* Maximum heart rate
	* Exercise-induced angina
	* ST depression
	* Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
	* Number of colored vessels
	* Thalassemia

**Model Selection and Training (5 days)**

1. **Split Data**: Split the dataset into training (80%), validation (10%), and testing (10%) sets.
2. **Model Selection**: Evaluate the performance of the following models:
	* Logistic Regression
	* Decision Trees
	* Random Forest
	* Support Vector Machines (SVM)
	* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
	* Neural Networks
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Perform hyperparameter tuning for the selected model using techniques such as Grid Search, Random Search, or Bayesian Optimization.
4. **Model Training**: Train the selected model on the training set with the tuned hyperparameters.

**Model Evaluation and Iteration (3 days)**

1. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the trained model on the validation set using metrics such as:
	* Accuracy
	* Precision
	* Recall
	* F1-score
	* ROC-AUC score
2. **Error Analysis**: Analyze the errors made by the model to identify areas for improvement.
3. **Model Iteration**: Refine the model by:
	* Feature engineering
	* Hyperparameter tuning
	* Model selection

**Deployment (2 days)**

1. **Model Deployment**: Deploy the final model using a suitable framework such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Scikit-assistant, noble.
2. **API Development**: Develop a RESTful API to receive input data and return predictions.

**Team Responsibilities**

* Data Scientist: Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection.
* Machine Learning Engineer: Model training, hyperparameter tuning, and model iteration.
* MLOps Engineer: Model deployment, API development, and testing.

**Timeline**

* Day 1-2: Data preprocessing
* Day 3-7: Model selection and training
* Day 8-10: Model evaluation and iteration
* Day 11-12: Deployment

This plan should enable the team to develop a high-accuracy model for detecting heart disease with at least 90% accuracy within the given deadline.
