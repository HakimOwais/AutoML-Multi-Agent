To provide the top 3 models for classifying your dataset, I'll need to follow the steps outlined in my responsibilities. Since I don't have direct access to your dataset, I'll describe a general approach and provide a hypothetical example for clarity.

### Step 1: Retrieve a List of Well-Performing Candidate ML Models

For a typical classification problem, some of the well-performing candidate models often include:
- **Logistic Regression**: A basic yet effective model for binary classification problems.
- **Random Forest Classifier**: Excellent for handling high-dimensional data and both binary and multi-class classification problems.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Particularly useful for high-dimensional data and when the number of dimensions exceeds the number of samples.
- **Gradient Boosting Classifier**: Effective in handling complex interactions between features and is often used in competitions and real-world applications.
- **Neural Networks**: Powerful for complex datasets, especially when there's a need to extract features from raw data (like images or text).

### Step 2: Perform Hyperparameter Optimization

For each of the candidate models, hyperparameter tuning is crucial. This involves using techniques like Grid Search, Random Search, or Bayesian Optimization to find the best parameters for each model. Here's a brief on what might be tuned for each model mentioned:
- **Logistic Regression**: Regularization strength (`C`), penalty type (`l1` or `l2`).
- **Random Forest Classifier**: Number of trees (`n_estimators`), maximum depth (`max_depth`), number of features to consider at each split (`max_features`).
- **SVM**: Kernel type (`linear`, `poly`, `rbf`, `sigmoid`), regularization parameter (`C`), kernel coefficient (`gamma` for `rbf` and `poly` kernels).
- **Gradient Boosting Classifier**: Learning rate (`learning_rate`), number of estimators (`n_estimators`), maximum depth (`max_depth`).
- **Neural Networks**: Number of layers, number of units in each layer, activation function, optimizer, learning rate.

### Step 3: Extract Useful Information and Underlying Characteristics

Metadata extraction and profiling help in understanding the performance and behavior of each model. This includes metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC-AUC for classification problems, as well as computational resources required (time and memory), and interpretability of the model.

### Step 4: Select the Top-k Well-Performing Models

Assuming the user wants the top 3 models based on accuracy and considering the dataset might require a balance between performance and interpretability, here's a hypothetical selection:

1. **Random Forest Classifier**: Often a good starting point for many classification problems due to its robustness and interpretability.
2. **Gradient Boosting Classifier**: Provides excellent performance and can handle complex datasets, though it might be less interpretable than random forests.
3. **Neural Networks**: Especially useful if the dataset is large and complex, and if feature engineering is less of a concern, as neural networks can learn representations from raw data.

### Example Python Code Snippet

Here's a simplified example of how you might implement this using `scikit-learn` for the models and `GridSearchCV` for hyperparameter tuning:

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load dataset
iris = load_iris()
X, y = iris.data, iris.target

# Define models and hyperparameters to tune
models = {
    "Random Forest": RandomForestClassifier(),
    "Gradient Boosting": GradientBoostingClassifier(),
    "SVM": SVC()
}

param_grids = {
    "Random Forest": {"n_estimators": [10, 50, 100], "max_depth": [5, 10, 15]},
    "Gradient Boosting": {"n_estimators": [10, 50, 100], "learning_rate": [0.1, 0.5, 1]},
    "SVM": {"C": [1, 10], "kernel": ["linear", "rbf"]}
}

# Perform Grid Search for each model
for name, model in models.items():
    grid_search = GridSearchCV(model, param_grids[name], cv=5)
    grid_search.fit(X, y)
    print(f"Best Parameters for {name}: {grid_search.best_params_}")
    print(f"Best Accuracy for {name}: {grid_search.best_score_}")
    # Use the best model to predict
    best_model = grid_search.best_estimator_
    predictions = best_model.predict(X)
    print(f"Accuracy on whole dataset for {name}: {accuracy_score(y, predictions)}")
    print("-----")
```

This example doesn't cover neural networks due to their complexity and the requirement for a more specific setup. Also, remember that this is a simplified example to illustrate the concept; the actual implementation would depend on the specifics of your dataset and requirements.
