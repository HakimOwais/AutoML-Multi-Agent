**Deploying the Selected Model as a Web Application**
======================================================

In this section, we will deploy the trained model as a web application using the Gradio library. Gradio is a Python library that allows us to create simple web-based interfaces for our models.

**Installing Required Libraries**
--------------------------------

Before we start, make sure to install the required libraries by running the following command:
```bash
pip install gradio
```

**Building the Web Application**
-------------------------------

Here is an example code snippet that demonstrates how to build a web application using Gradio:
```python
import gradio as gr
import torch
from torch import nn
from torchvision import models

# Load the trained model
model = models.resnet50(pretrained=True)
num_ftrs = model.fc.in_features
model.fc = nn.Linear(num_ftrs, 10)  # Change the output layer to match the number of classes

# Load the state dictionary of the trained model
model.load_state_dict(torch.load("model.pth"))

# Define a function that takes an input image and returns the predicted class
def predict_image(image):
    image = image.resize((224, 224))  # Resize the image to match the input shape of the model
    image = torch.tensor([image]).permute(0, 3, 1, 2)  # Convert the image to a tensor
    output = model(image)  # Pass the image through the model
    _, predicted = torch.max(output, 1)  # Get the predicted class
    return predicted.item()

# Create a Gradio interface
interface = gr.Interface(
    predict_image,
    gr.Image(shape=(224, 224), type="pil"),
    "label",
    title="Image Classification Model",
    description="Upload an image to classify it"
)

# Launch the web application
interface.launch()
```

**Running the Web Application**
-----------------------------

To run the web application, save the above code snippet to a file (e.g., `app.py`) and run it using the following command:
```bash
python app.py
```

This will launch a web application that allows users to upload an image and classify it using the trained model.

**Model Evaluation**
-------------------

To evaluate the model, we can use the following code snippet:
```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
from torchvision import datasets, transforms

# Define a function to evaluate the model on a test dataset
def evaluate_model(model, test_loader):
    model.eval()
    total_correct = 0
    with torch.no_grad():
        for images, labels in test_loader:
            images, labels = images.to(device), labels.to(device)
            output = model(images)
            _, predicted = torch.max(output, 1)
            total_correct += (predicted == labels).sum().item()
    accuracy = total_correct / len(test_loader.dataset)
    return accuracy

# Load the test dataset
test_dataset = datasets.CIFAR10(root="./data", train=False, download=True, transform=transforms.ToTensor())
test_loader = DataLoader(test_dataset, batch_size=64, shuffle=False)

# Evaluate the model on the test dataset
accuracy = evaluate_model(model, test_loader)
print(f"Test Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}%")
```

**Results**
-----------

The results of the model evaluation will be printed to the console, showing the test accuracy of the model.

Note: This is just an example code snippet and may need to be modified to suit your specific use case. Additionally, this code assumes that the model is trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, but you can modify it to work with other datasets and models.
