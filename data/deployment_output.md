**Deploying the Model as a Web Application**
====================================================

In this step, we will deploy the trained model as a web application using the Gradio library. Gradio is a Python library that allows us to create simple and shareable web applications for our machine learning models.

**Required Libraries and Imports**
--------------------------------

```python
import gradio as gr
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import torch
from torchvision import models
from PIL import Image
from torch import nn
import torchvision.transforms as transforms
```

**Loading the Trained Model**
-----------------------------

```python
# Load the trained model
model = torch.load('model.pth', map_location=torch.device('cpu'))
model.eval()
```

**Defining the Prediction Function**
----------------------------------

```python
# Define a function to make predictions
def predict(image):
    # Preprocess the input image
    transform = transforms.Compose([
        transforms.Resize((224, 224)),
        transforms.ToTensor(),
        transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
    ])
    image = transform(image)
    
    # Make a prediction using the trained model
    output = model(image.unsqueeze(0))
    _, predicted = torch.max(output, 1)
    
    # Return the predicted class label
    return predicted.item()
```

**Creating the Gradio Interface**
-------------------------------

```python
# Create a Gradio interface for the web application
demo = gr.Interface(
    predict,
    gr.Image(label='Input Image'),
    gr.Label(label='Predicted Class Label')
)

# Launch the Gradio interface
demo.launch()
```

**Running the Web Application**
------------------------------

To run the web application, save the above code in a file (e.g., `app.py`) and run it using the following command:
```bash
python app.py
```
This will launch the Gradio interface in your default web browser. You can then upload an image to the interface and see the predicted class label.

**Model Evaluation**
-------------------

To evaluate the performance of the model, you can use the following functions:
```python
# Define a function to evaluate the model
def evaluate_model(model, test_data):
    # Evaluate the model on the test data
    model.eval()
    correct = 0
    total = 0
    with torch.no_grad():
        for images, labels in test_data:
            outputs = model(images)
            _, predicted = torch.max(outputs, 1)
            total += labels.size(0)
            correct += (predicted == labels).sum().item()
    
    # Calculate the accuracy
    accuracy = correct / total
    return accuracy

# Load the test data
test_data = ...  # Load the test data

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = evaluate_model(model, test_data)
print(f'Test Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}')
```
This will print the test accuracy of the model.

**Results Summary**
--------------------

After running the web application and evaluating the model, you can summarize the results as follows:

* The model is deployed as a web application using the Gradio library.
* The web application allows users to upload an image and see the predicted class label.
* The model achieves an accuracy of [insert accuracy value] on the test data.
* The web application is a simple and effective way to demonstrate the capabilities of the model.
