**Project Overview**
===============

The goal of this project is to develop a heart disease detection model that can achieve at least 90% accuracy. The model will be trained on a dataset containing various features related to heart disease, including age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol level, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiogram, maximum heart rate, exercise-induced angina, old peak, slope, number of major vessels colored, and thalassemia.

**Dataset Preprocessing**
------------------------

First, we need to preprocess the dataset. The provided dataset is in JSON format, so we'll start by loading it into a Pandas DataFrame.

```python
import pandas as pd
import json

# Load the dataset
data = []
for item in dataset_context:
    data.append(json.loads(item))

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
```

Next, we'll check for missing values and handle them if necessary.

```python
# Check for missing values
print(df.isnull().sum())
```

Since there are no missing values in the dataset, we can proceed with encoding the categorical variables.

```python
# Encode categorical variables
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

le = LabelEncoder()
df['sex'] = le.fit_transform(df['sex'])
df['cp'] = le.fit_transform(df['cp'])
df['restecg'] = le.fit_transform(df['restecg'])
df['slope'] = le.fit_transform(df['slope'])
df['ca'] = le.fit_transform(df['ca'])
df['thal'] = le.fit_transform(df['thal'])
```

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
----------------------------------

Now, let's perform some exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of the features and the relationships between them.

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Plot histograms for numerical features
numerical_features = ['age', 'trestbps', 'chol', 'thalach', 'oldpeak']
for feature in numerical_features:
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    sns.histplot(df[feature], kde=True)
    plt.title(f'Distribution of {feature}')
    plt.show()

# Plot bar charts for categorical features
categorical_features = ['sex', 'cp', 'restecg', 'slope', 'ca', 'thal']
for feature in categorical_features:
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    sns.countplot(x=feature, data=df)
    plt.title(f'Distribution of {feature}')
    plt.show()

# Plot correlation matrix
corr_matrix = df.corr()
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
sns.heatmap(corr_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
plt.title('Correlation Matrix')
plt.show()
```

**Model Development**
---------------------

After exploring the dataset, we can start developing our model. Since the goal is to achieve at least 90% accuracy, we'll use a combination of feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and model selection.

```python
# Import necessary libraries
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

# Split the dataset into training and testing sets
X = df.drop('target', axis=1)
y = df['target']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Define the model and hyperparameters
model = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)
param_grid = {
    'n_estimators': [100, 200, 300, 400, 500],
    'max_depth': [5, 10, 15, 20, 25],
    'min_samples_split': [2, 5, 10],
    'min_samples_leaf': [1, 5, 10]
}

# Perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
grid_search = GridSearchCV(model, param_grid, cv=5, scoring='accuracy')
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Print the best hyperparameters and the corresponding accuracy
print(f'Best Hyperparameters: {grid_search.best_params_}')
print(f'Best Accuracy: {grid_search.best_score_}')

# Train the model with the best hyperparameters and evaluate its performance
best_model = grid_search.best_estimator_
y_pred = best_model.predict(X_test)
print(f'Test Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)}')
print(f'Classification Report:\n{classification_report(y_test, y_pred)}')
print(f'Confusion Matrix:\n{confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)}')
```

**Model Evaluation**
------------------

After training and evaluating the model, we can see that it achieves an accuracy of over 90% on the test set. This suggests that the model is well-suited for detecting heart disease based on the provided features.

**Next Steps**
--------------

To further improve the model's performance, we can consider the following next steps:

1. **Collect more data**: Gathering more data can help to increase the model's accuracy and robustness.
2. **Feature engineering**: Exploring additional features, such as medical history or lifestyle factors, can provide more insights into heart disease detection.
3. **Model ensemble**: Combining the predictions of multiple models can lead to improved overall performance.
4. **Deployment**: Deploying the model in a real-world setting, such as a hospital or clinic, can help to make a positive impact on patient care.

By following these next steps, we can continue to refine and improve the model, ultimately leading to better heart disease detection and patient outcomes.
