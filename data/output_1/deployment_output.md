**Deploying the Model as a Web Application**

To deploy the selected model as a web application, we will use the Gradio library, which provides a simple and intuitive way to create web-based interfaces for machine learning models.

### Step 1: Import the Required Libraries

```python
import gradio as gr
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
```

### Step 2: Load the Trained Model

```python
# Load the trained model
model = load_model('model.h5')
```

### Step 3: Define the Prediction Function

```python
# Define the prediction function
def predict(input_data):
    # Preprocess the input data
    input_data = pd.DataFrame(input_data, columns=['feature1', 'feature2', 'feature3'])
    
    # Make predictions using the trained model
    predictions = model.predict(input_data)
    
    # Return the predictions
    return predictions
```

### Step 4: Create the Gradio Interface

```python
# Create the Gradio interface
demo = gr.Interface(
    fn=predict,
    inputs=[
        gr.Textbox(label='Feature 1'),
        gr.Textbox(label='Feature 2'),
        gr.Textbox(label='Feature 3')
    ],
    outputs=[
        gr.Number(label='Prediction')
    ],
    title='Machine Learning Model Deployment',
    description='Enter the input features to get a prediction from the model.'
)
```

### Step 5: Launch the Gradio Interface

```python
# Launch the Gradio interface
if __name__ == '__main__':
    demo.launch()
```

**Model Evaluation**

To evaluate the performance of the deployed model, we can use the following metrics:

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* F1-score

We can use the following Python function to evaluate the model:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score

def evaluate_model(y_true, y_pred):
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred)
    precision = precision_score(y_true, y_pred)
    recall = recall_score(y_true, y_pred)
    f1 = f1_score(y_true, y_pred)
    
    print('Model Evaluation Metrics:')
    print('Accuracy:', accuracy)
    print('Precision:', precision)
    print('Recall:', recall)
    print('F1-score:', f1)
```

To use this function, we need to provide the true labels (`y_true`) and the predicted labels (`y_pred`) as input.

**Example Use Case**

Suppose we have a dataset with the following features and labels:

| Feature 1 | Feature 2 | Feature 3 | Label |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1.2 | 3.4 | 5.6 | 1 |
| 2.3 | 4.5 | 6.7 | 0 |
| 3.4 | 5.6 | 7.8 | 1 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

We can use the Gradio interface to input the features and get a prediction from the model. For example, if we input the following features:

* Feature 1: 1.2
* Feature 2: 3.4
* Feature 3: 5.6

The model will predict the label as 1.

We can then use the `evaluate_model` function to evaluate the performance of the model using the true labels and predicted labels.

Note: This is a simplified example and may not represent a real-world scenario. The actual deployment and evaluation of a machine learning model can be more complex and may require additional steps and considerations.
